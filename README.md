This code base implements Cooperative A-star and Windowed Hierarchial cooperative A-start algorithms developed by [David Silver](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coop-path-AIWisdom.pdf)

The initial code is for Cooperative A-star which aims to reroute paths of subsequent robots based on the previous completed paths of the other/ previous robots

To run the simulation:
  Run test.py in the scripts folder
